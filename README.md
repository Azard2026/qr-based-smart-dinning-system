# qr-based-smart-dinning-system



ABSTRACT
    In a restaurant's traditional way of ordering meals, customers first browse through the menu of the restaurant and then wait for a waiter to come and take orders.
    This procedure can be slow during busy hours and can reduce customer satisfaction.
    It is therefore susceptible to errors made by humans.
    Automated systems can be used to automate procedures by eliminating errors made by humans, reducing paper waste, and making ordering processes more time and cost-effective. 
    There have been numerous attempts to automate the ordering process in restaurants in recent years.
    This project work aims to propose a QR based smart dining system for simplify the restaurant functionalities using smartphones.
    The customer can scan the QR code which is set on the table, and open the current menu to order the food. 
    Upon ordering, the notification will be delivered to the cashier along with the table number.
    Customer can made the payment for their ordered. The current menu and offers will be updated on this menu. 
    This method ensures time and customer satisfaction with restaurant. Also, the implementation cost is less.
